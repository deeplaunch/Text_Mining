39,"WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.</br></br>Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.</br></br>The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)</br></br>The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.</br></br>In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January.

46,"NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.</br></br>That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.</br></br>""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""</br></br>The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's ""relief"" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds.</br></br>""The fixation on the `big' overall number of new jobs isn't sane,"" says one trader, disgruntled after a day of fielding more calls than he says he gets in an average week, all from clients seeking insight into a single figure.",4.0,0
47,"Consumers aren't stepping up spending at the pace many retailers expected just a few months ago, raising the specter that stores will be stuck with piles of unsold goods later this year.</br></br>This dimming retail picture is part of a larger downshift in growth occurring across the economy. Consumer confidence slumped last month and the job market remains weak. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported consumer borrowing fell in May, another sign that they are wary about their finances.</br></br>All this bodes poorly for the kind of snapback in spending many stores anticipated only a few months ago. Last year's holiday sales were strong and many retailers expected robust growth to continue through this year, fueled in part by pent-up demand for washing machines and clothes that weren't bought during the recession.</br></br>The typical retailer has to place orders four months or more in advance of actual sales -- which makes them susceptible in the event that sales fail to materialize or simply grow much more slowly than expected.</br></br>Slower growth could mean stores will be stuck with excess inventory.

Things didn't look so good for Northview a year ago, when its chairman, Ivan Boesky, came under fire for his misdeeds on Wall Street.

86,"The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.</br></br>In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.</br></br>Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.</br></br>But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures.

""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us.""

The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.</br></br>As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year.

124,"NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.</br></br>There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.</br></br>In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.</br></br>The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.</br></br>The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains.",7.0,1

In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.</br></br>But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</br></br>In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression.

666,"Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.</br></br>And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?</br></br>Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.</br></br>Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.</br></br>Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end. But the reasons to doubt the current bear-market consensus go beyond that line of analysis.",7.0,1

1012,"NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.</br></br>Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.</br></br>Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.</br></br>This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.</br></br>Further substantial increases seem probable.

In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.</br></br>The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.</br></br>American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending.

While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.</br></br>That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable lives</br></br>Concern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.</br></br>Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.</br></br>This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class.

While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.</br></br>The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.</br></br>These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.</br></br>Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.</br></br>To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends.

The Philadelphia Fed, for example, found strong demand for electrical machinery, metals and glass products. ""It's not a boom, mind you,"" a steel production representative cautioned the Chicago Fed. Indeed, purchase orders mostly softened in the Dallas and Cleveland districts.</br></br>In keeping with what analysts call a slow but steadily growing economy, construction improved slightly, and there was a ""firming"" in commercial and industrial leasing activity. Also, inflation remains under control. Wage gains were moderate, despite mostly tight labor markets, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs fell off substantially, the report said.</br></br>But the reluctance of consumers to spend is keeping the slow-rolling economy from shedding its training wheels. In the Boston district, where sales in September and October fell by as much as 20% from the year-earlier period, widespread discounting is ""eating away at gross margins and profits,"" the Boston Fed said. Without any intriguing new fashion offerings, apparel sales continue to fare the worst. But the New York Fed said sales of big-ticket items such as furniture and home electronics also softened.",4.0,0
1291,"Author: Alan Greenspan</br></br>An urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.</br></br>Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.</br></br>The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.</br></br>Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008. How much borrowing leeway at current interest rates remains for U.S. Treasury financing is highly uncertain.",4.0,0

As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.</br></br>Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates.

And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.</br></br>At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly. So far, that hasn't been happening. Average hourly earnings were up just 2.1% in May versus a year earlier, and the Labor Department on Tuesday reported that, when adjusted for inflation, they were actually a shade lower.</br></br>But companies think they will soon be paying more. This month, a quarterly survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine showed that U.S. chief financial officers expect wages and salaries at their companies to increase 3% over the next 12 months. Last June, they had expected year-ahead gains of 2.5%. Further, they now expect their workforces to increase 1.9% versus 0.8% a year ago.</br></br>That leaves the little matter of how companies will pay for those bigger, more expensive workforces.",6.0,1

The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.</br></br>Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.</br></br>Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.</br></br>The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.</br></br>International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home.",3.0,0

As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.</br></br>Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant.

American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit.

1672,"Even amoebas learn by trial and error, but some economists and politicians do not. The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.</br></br>Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""</br></br>Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.</br></br>Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.</br></br>On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%.

Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable.

As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force.

But it took a large rise in services employment to offset substantial declines in manufacturing and construction employment, according to the department's survey of business payrolls. The average hours of factory workers also dropped, to 40.0 a week from 40.6. Together, the numbers suggest industrial production actually fell in the month.</br></br>Analysts believe some of the decline in manufacturing and construction may have been tied to harsh weather during February. But the numbers also seem to suggest that manufacturers have yet to fully recover from the sluggish growth that occurred in last year's third quarter.</br></br>""The decline in manufacturing reflects the overbuilding of inventories in late 1984 and increased import penetration as a result of the rapid escalation of the dollar,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.</br></br>Companies should be able to work off excess inventories in the next month or two.

That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.</br></br>Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.</br></br>On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.</br></br>This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans.

1875,"Not all borrowers are benefiting from the Fed's moves to cut interest rates. The problem: Loans that are tied to a variety of interest-rate benchmarks -- some of which aren't necessarily moving in lockstep with Fed action.</br></br>Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% -- the central bank's third rate cut since mid-September -- to help ease the credit crunch and reduce the economy's chances of falling into a recession. The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.</br></br>But rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.</br></br>Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%.

1884,"In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.</br></br>It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.</br></br>Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself.

Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.</br></br>Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.</br></br>Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural.

Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.</br></br>In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.</br></br>It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again.

His plan is to move the economy ""forward"" by keeping the current policy framework in place and adding higher tax rates on income and capital gains. But the new Commerce Department numbers, combined with his stay-the-course approach, point to recession in 2013.</br></br>This administration's economic policy is built on deficit spending, government control over the economy and dependence on the Federal Reserve to buy the government's excess debt. These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.</br></br>The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.</br></br>These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.</br></br>The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government.",3.0,0
2317,"Beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately. But the greenback may be about to get off the mat.</br></br>The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.</br></br>For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.</br></br>And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)</br></br>By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns.",6.0,1

2330,"Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.</br></br>In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.</br></br>Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.</br></br>Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.</br></br>This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France.",7.0,1

The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse.</br></br>To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.</br></br>Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.</br></br>Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, ""stayed the course.""</br></br>Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined.

The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period.

2788,"The presumed American birthright of rising living standards has been on hold for 15 years. Average hourly pay of blue-collar and clerical workers is slightly lower in purchasing power now than it was in 1973 and has made no progress even in the prosperous mid-1980s. Counting managers, professionals, other self-employed people, and the rising share of employee compensation received as fringe benefits, real earnings per hour have increased only 0.7% a year from 1973 through 1987.</br></br>Income per capita has risen faster than income per hour because a larger share of the adult population is working more hours per capita. In other words, we are working harder for it, and this has its cost in leisure, child care, and home-cooked meals. Per-capita income also rose faster than hourly pay because of the faster rise in interest income and Social Security.</br></br>The reasons for stagnant real wages will be much debated in this election year. But this epoch may now be ending, regardless of who becomes the next president.</br></br>The world's postwar economic boom foundered in the 1970s just when the U.S. labor force was growing at a pace unmatched since early in the century. Pay fell behind oil-fueled price rises partly because plentiful young workers were a drag on productivity. Young and other marginal workers, including swelling ranks of low-income single mothers, lost ground rapidly relative to others in the general retrenchment in the 1980s.</br></br>Intense foreign competition, due mainly to exchange-rate maladjustments, held down wages (as well as prices and profits) in the mid-1980s in all industries exposed to international competition. Some of the lag in average wages stemmed from erosion of union wage scales that were out of line with the rest of the economy. Union wages in manufacturing, construction and transportation have been undermined by spreading nonunion competition. Federal deregulation of the airline and trucking industries accelerated the breakdown of their sheltered wage and price structures by allowing new competition in markets that for decades had been protected.",6.0,1

With such a slow economy, any job-creation is good. Aside from the growth in government positions, the service sector added 110,000 jobs in July, following a meager increase in June.

The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5% and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs.</br></br>The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates.</br></br>But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a ""bias adjustment factor"" that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires.</br></br>The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998.</br></br>Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months.

3217,"INFLATION. DEFLATION. Disinflation. The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.</br></br>As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.</br></br>The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled ""The Reflation Trade,"" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a ""full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation."" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a ""global reflation program"" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.</br></br>SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. ""There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,"" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.</br></br>Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is ""extraordinarily sensitive"" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports.",4.0,0

Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:</br></br>-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.</br></br>Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades.

If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.</br></br>If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers.

3367,"When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</br></br>There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.</br></br>As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.</br></br>The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.</br></br>Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.",4.0,0

3497,"NEW YORK -- The financial markets for weeks have been hoping for an economic slowdown. The economy has been roaring along at a pace that makes analysts worry about a future upsurge of inflation. Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.</br></br>To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.</br></br>The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.</br></br>As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.</br></br>Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength. The numbers on the first-quarter gross national product, in order, were 7.2%, 8.3%, 8.8% and now 9.7%.",4.0,0

3822,"Higher energy prices, a lousy housing market and tighter credit continue to put the squeeze on consumers -- and Wal-Mart and Home Depot are feeling their pain.</br></br>Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.</br></br>In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. ""It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,"" he said. ""The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been."" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an ""ebb tide in low-end consumer spending."" Goldman Sachs faulted ""the tougher macro environment"" for making the company's turnaround ""even tougher to enact,"" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's ""efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season."" And HSBC's note, echoing Mr. Scott, affirmed that the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle means that, for consumers, ""inflation takes a bite out of real spending growth.""</br></br>In that regard, there was a glimmer of good news in economic data released Tuesday. Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports.

Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.</br></br>The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied.

Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago.

4603,"The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.</br></br>However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.</br></br>Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.</br></br>The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.</br></br>Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components.",3.0,0

4699,"The pending farm bill provides no parity for the poor. Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. ItÛªs asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.</br></br>For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isnÛªt surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.</br></br>The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.</br></br>Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.</br></br>They arenÛªt all wrong.

""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency.

Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""</br></br>Wrote R. W.

What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes.

As they cut back, there was a slowing of economic activity, which eventually showed up in a layjjjg-off of workers. Unemployment thus figured as a ÛÏlagging indicator.Ûª'",4.0,0

5596,"Our leading financial institutions announced that they had actually made a profit in the year's first quarter through the creative manipulation of rules and regulations, lobbied Congress to preserve their ability to raise credit card interest rates just for the heck of it and opposed the administration's plan for restructuring Chrysler, which would save some jobs and honor pension obligations, in the hope that they can redeem the company's bonds at a higher level than they're trading at just now. And, to round out the picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent lower in February -- by which time these banks had received hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to enable them to lend more -- than it had been in October, before the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.</br></br>The week began with a burst of creative accounting. Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value, because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.</br></br>As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, though that ""more"" could only come at the expense of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers who are keeping Chrysler alive.</br></br>Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler their accountants.

For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.</br></br>Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.</br></br>The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do.",3.0,0

6145,"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.</br></br>As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.</br></br>Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.</br></br>* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.</br></br>* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s.",3.0,0

6292,"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.</br></br>What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.</br></br>There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.</br></br>Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.</br></br>On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually.",3.0,0

6716,"ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.</br></br>The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.</br></br>The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.</br></br>The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.</br></br>Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs.

7392,"NOT ALL OF THE inflation in this country is coming in from the Persian Gulf, and not all of it is imposed by OPEC. After the recent attention to the increases in oil prices, and their contribution to the probability of a recession, itÛªs useful to take a look at the prices of another basic commodity, steel. OPEC has held oil prices steady this year but, as you doubtless saw, intends to raise them 14.5 percent in the coming year. By an instructive coincidence, 14.5 percent is just about the average increase in steel prices over the past year, and there is more to come in January.</br></br>This disproportionately fast run-up in steel prices is the resultÛÓunintentional, but realÛÓof the Carter administrationÛªs attempts to protect the U.S. steel industry from its foreign competitors. The American producers had been complaining that the foreign mills were selling steel here below cost, to avoid unemployment at home. That's called dumping, and itÛªs illegal. Just about a year ago, the Treasury Department announced its trigger price system. It calculated the real cost of making steel in the most efficient millsÛÓJapanÛªsÛÓand any steel imported below that price was to trigger ail immediate dumping investigation. It was an ingenious idea. Unfortunately, it did not foresee the drastic rise in the value of the Japanese yen throughout 1978.</br></br>As the yen soared, it took the trigger prices up \v ith it. Knowing that their foreign competitors would not come into this country below the trigger price, the American companies raised their own prices right along with the triggers. The trigger system became, in a manner of speaking, price controls in reverse. Instead of a ceiling holding prices down, for the American producers it provided a floor under pricesÛÓand, as in an elevator, the floor was rising. The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.</br></br>reaction to the closing of steel mills in OhioÛªs Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.</br></br>What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. ItÛªs the first of four increments scheduled for 1979. On the same day, the Treasury has announced, the steel trigger prices will go up another 7 percent under the automatic formula.

""Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants."" A copy of the text was released in Washington.</br></br>California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a ""worrisome situation for Californians, certainly,"" Greenspan said.

Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date.""</br></br>Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment.</br></br>""As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices"" of the things they sell, he said.",4.0,0

7715,"IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.</br></br>But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.</br></br>Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.</br></br>Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.</br></br>By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago.
